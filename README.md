16745 Opt. Control Project folder.


This project explores the application of Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control to bipedal humanoid robots in a fully simulated environment. The primary objective is to enable stable locomotion through optimal control techniques, which will be used to collect trajectory and state-action data.

Following the simulation phase, we aim to apply supervised learning methods to model the robot's underlying dynamics. The learned model will then be used to adapt and improve control policies, ultimately enabling the humanoid to walk autonomously using the data-driven control approach.
